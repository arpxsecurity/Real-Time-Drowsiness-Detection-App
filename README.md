# Real-Time Drowsiness Detection App

📌 Overview
The Real-Time Drowsiness Detection App is a computer vision based application designed to detect driver fatigue in real time. It monitors facial features and eye movements to identify signs of drowsiness and triggers alerts to help prevent fatigue-related accidents.

❗ Problem Statement
Driver drowsiness is a major cause of road accidents worldwide. Long driving hours, lack of sleep, medications, or medical conditions can reduce alertness, making drivers prone to accidents. Early detection is critical for road safety.

🧠 How It Works
Detects face and eyes using Haar Cascades
Calculates Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) from facial landmarks
Identifies prolonged eye closure as a sign of drowsiness
Triggers real-time alerts when fatigue is detected

⭐ Key Features
Real-time drowsiness detection
Accurate eye state analysis using EAR
Instant alert system for preventive action
Combines Computer Vision & Machine Learning
Privacy-focused (no data storage)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
Haar Cascades
Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
Machine Learning

🎯 Impact
This project demonstrates how computer vision can be effectively used to enhance road safety by detecting drowsiness early and alerting drivers in real time.
